    description: >-
      A JSON object mapping workspace paths to either true if that workspace has
      changed (or any of its dependencies changed, recursively) or `false` if it
      has no changes (and doesn't need to be retested or rebuilt).
  paths:
    description: >-
      A JSON object mapping workspace aliases to paths, where a workspace alias
      is how a package manager refers to that workspace. This makes it easy to
      translate (e.g.) NPM package names or Cargo crate names to paths within
      the repository.
  workspaces:
    description: >-
      A JSON object mapping workspace paths to all known details about the workspace.
  base:
    description: >-
      The symbolic Git ref that the comparison was performed against. On pull
      requests, this will be set to `$GITHUB_BASE_REF`; otherwise it is `HEAD~`.
  base_commit:
    description: >-
      The Git commit hash that the comparison was performed against.
  time:
    description: >-
      The time the action was run, as an ISO 8601 timestamp with millisecond
      precision (JS `Date.toISOString`).
  time_unix:
    description: >-
      The time the action was run, as a UNIX timestamp.
  time_unix_ms:
    description: >-
      The time the action was run, as a UNIX timestamp expressed in milliseconds
      (JS `Date.now`).
